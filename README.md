# ImageResizer
This is a simple image resizer that resizes images to a specified width and height. It is written in C and uses the STB to load and write images.

## Usage
``` shell
./ImageResizer (Input path) (Width) (Height) (Output path)
```

## Details
The supported output file format is JPG. The input file format can be any format supported by STB. The output image will be resized to the specified width and height.
- **Note:** In general this is shitty implementation of the idea of image resizing. It is not recommended to use this for any serious work(there is way better alternatives). This is just a simple project to learn about image processing and nothing more. Right now i'm not planning to work much on this project. **But if you want to improve it, feel free to do so.**
